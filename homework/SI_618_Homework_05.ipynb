    "This dataset was obtained from the Google Jobs API through serpAPI and contains information about job offers for data scientists in companies based in the United States of America (USA). The data may include details such as job title, company name, location, job description, salary range, and other relevant information. The dataset is likely to be valuable for individuals seeking to understand the job market for data scientists in the USA and for companies looking to recruit data scientists. It may also be useful for researchers who are interested in exploring trends and patterns in the job market for data scientists. The data should be used with caution, as the API source may not cover all job offers in the USA and the information provided by the companies may not always be accurate or up-to-date.\n",
