    "You're a Data Science Consultant for an eCommerce retail company, they've asked you to analyze their sales database. Unfortunately, they did nothing to prepare or clean their data, only exporting their 3 database tables as JSON files. It's up to you to clean their data, analyze it and answer questions to help drive business value!\n",

    "* If the InvoiceNo starts with the letter 'c', it indicates a cancellation. When conducting this analysis we only want to analyze invoices that were shipped. (ie. not canceled)\n",
    "* The datasets should be able to be merged, each row in the invoice table corresponds to multiple rows in the purchases table.\n",
    "* To find out the description or unit cost of an item in the purchase table, the StockCode should be used to match up the product in the items table. \n",
    "* They mentioned that they've been having a difficult time lately joining the items and purchases table, maybe there's something wrong with the columns?"
